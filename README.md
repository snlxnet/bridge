# snlx.net bridge (work in progress)

> bridge is a plugin that ties Obsidian.md to my site

I built this project for myself, it's wouldn't be useful for anyone else as-is,
though forking or reading its sources may be.

Currently the
secret notes are not implemented, I'll fix that soon and post about it on the main site.
Incremental updates are already implemented.
Expect a link to appear here within a week.
