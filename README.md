# snlx.net bridge (work in progress)

> bridge is a plugin that ties Obsidian.md to my site

I built this project for myself, it's wouldn't be useful for anyone else as-is,
though forking or reading its sources may be.

Currently the GitHub integration doesn't check for changes and uploads everything and
secret notes are not implemented, I'll fix that soon and post about it on the main site.
Expect a link to appear here within a week.
